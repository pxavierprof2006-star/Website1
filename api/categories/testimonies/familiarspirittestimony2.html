    Intro: Familiar Spirits Testimony 02:
    </br></br>
    In march 2025, I met somebody at my job. My coworker asked to pray for him since he didnt have any food in his fridge. SO I DID. I let him know the next day, and gave him my number if he ever needed something or a ride. A few days after, he texted me asking for a ride. Now I was very passionate and loud about Jesus back then, so of course i started talking about him a lot. This person was interested and told me hes met other religious people lately and he invited me over after work. He was very interested, he told me his entire life story, and then told me he feels pain in his back and thinks he has a spirit.
    he showed me his back and i saw red marks. he told me sometimes at night he wakes up to a bunch of scratches and when hes happy his back and neck hurts. the next day i was invited for a prayer session at church so i went. At church, I told the people that somebody I knew had an evil spirit. The lady said that I should put my right hand on my left shoulder and say "cast you out in the name of Jesus", but then I asked when to cast it out. The lady and guy started arguing. The lady said it doesnt matter, then the guy said once hes a believer because verse 43 “When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. 44 Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order. 45 Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation.”. Then the lady said "well it doesnt matter because if the evil spirit leaves when hes not a believer he will start to believe so he will be safe". So i interrupted and said "ok guys lets pray. God, could you please let me know when is the right time to cast out the evil spirit and how" The next day (sunday) I invited my coworker to church. When we arrived, he started to have LOTS of social anxiety hes never had before and was very disoriented insite the church. THe evil spirit was NOT happy. So i put my right hand on his left shoulder and it calmed him down. After service, he told me he believed in Jesus now. So we went in my car to go back home and in my car we prayed. I said repeat after me, "Bind and rebuke, the pain in my back and neck, the evil spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ who is more powerful then anything and is God Amen." after that prayer, he told me that he felt a bit of pain in his back for a split second, then it went away. So i thought maybe thats a sign that the evil spirit left right? We arrived at his place and we hangout some more. We talked for hours and he was about to take a hit of his bong and the evil spirit came back angrier. The spirit hasnt left at all! So me and him prayed some more. God helped us realize the evil spirit was there because of his addiction! So we gathered all his cigarettes and weed and threw it out. I kid you not... I saw the red marks on his back disappear
